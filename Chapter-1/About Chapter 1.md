# About Chapter One - Introduction to Machine Learning

This directory contains examples and homework from Chapter One of the AI course.

**Note: Run any Python file to see immediate educational output with clear explanations!**

## Key Concepts
- **ML Fundamentals**: Supervised/Unsupervised learning, dataset handling, train/test splits
- **Mathematics**: Gradient descent, loss functions (MSE, MAE, Binary Cross-Entropy), activation functions
- **Evaluation**: Regression metrics (MSE, MAE, RÂ²), classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1), confusion matrices

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** `pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`

**Run Examples:**
```bash
python examples/example_1_read_dataset.py        # Dataset info
python examples/example_5_gradient_descent.py    # Gradient descent in action
python examples/example_10_regression_metrics.py # Metric calculations
```

## Learning Goals
Learn ML fundamentals through hands-on examples with immediate visual output. Each file includes step-by-step calculations, visualizations, and verification against standard libraries.
