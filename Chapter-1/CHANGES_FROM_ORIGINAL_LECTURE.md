# Changes Made from Original Lecture Examples

## Key Modifications

### Technical Fixes
- **Example 1**: Removed deprecated `load_boston` dataset (replaced with alternatives)
- **Example 5**: Fixed gradient descent overflow issues with adaptive learning rates
- **Example 6**: Added numerical stability for log calculations in binary cross-entropy
- **Example 7**: Enhanced sigmoid function with overflow protection

### Educational Enhancements
- Added comprehensive print statements explaining each step
- Included visualizations for better understanding
- Enhanced error handling and edge case management
- Added comparison with scikit-learn implementations for validation

## Summary
All examples now run without errors, include better explanations, and provide educational value through step-by-step breakdowns and visualizations.
**Changes:**
- Fixed array broadcasting issue in probability distribution visualization
- Enhanced probability generation using proper boolean indexing

**Reasons:**
- Original `np.where` usage caused broadcasting errors with incompatible array shapes
- Fixed by using proper indexing with boolean masks for different classes
- Ensures visualization works correctly for all sample sizes

### 4. Example 7 - Sigmoid Activation (`example_7_sigmoid_activation.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added overflow protection by clipping z values to [-500, 500]
- Enhanced visualizations and mathematical explanations

**Reasons:**
- Original sigmoid function can cause overflow errors for large input values
- `np.clip(-500, 500)` prevents numerical instability while maintaining function behavior
- Enhanced educational content provides deeper understanding

### 5. Example 8 - Tanh Activation (`example_8_tanh_activation.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive comparisons with other activation functions
- Enhanced visualizations showing derivatives and properties

**Reasons:**
- Provides deeper understanding beyond basic definition
- Shows relationships between different activation functions
- Includes practical considerations for choosing activation functions

### 6. Example 9 - Softmax Activation (`example_9_softmax_activation.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added numerical stability by subtracting max value before exponentiation
- Enhanced with temperature scaling and multi-class examples

**Reasons:**
- Original softmax can cause overflow for large input values
- Subtracting `max(z)` prevents numerical overflow while maintaining mathematical correctness
- Shows practical applications and variations

### 7. Example 10 - Regression Metrics (`example_10_regression_metrics.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive metric calculations with manual implementations
- Enhanced visualizations showing residual analysis
- Added practical examples with different error types

**Reasons:**
- Provides complete understanding beyond basic definitions
- Shows how different metrics respond to different error types
- Includes both sklearn and manual implementations for learning
- Helps choose appropriate metrics for different scenarios

### 8. Example 11 - Confusion Matrix (`example_11_confusion_matrix.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive visualization with 12 different plots
- Added manual metric calculations with step-by-step explanations
- Added multi-class confusion matrix example
- Added threshold analysis and ROC-like curves

**Reasons:**
- Original likely showed basic confusion matrix concepts only
- Enhanced version provides complete understanding of classification metrics
- Includes both binary and multi-class scenarios
- Provides visual and mathematical intuition for all key concepts

## Homework Modified

### Homework 1 - Load Datasets (`homework_1_load_datasets.py`)
**Changes:**
- Removed `load_boston` from imports and dataset list

**Reasons:**
- Same as Example 1 - ethical concerns and ImportError in newer scikit-learn versions

## Common Themes in Changes

1. **Numerical Stability**: Added overflow protection and clipping to prevent crashes
2. **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and graceful degradation
3. **Educational Enhancement**: Added detailed explanations, visualizations, and step-by-step calculations
4. **Practical Considerations**: Included real-world scenarios and best practices
5. **Compatibility**: Fixed deprecated functions and updated for newer library versions

## Impact on Learning

These changes enhance the educational value by:
- Preventing crashes that would interrupt learning
- Showing both successful and problematic scenarios
- Providing deeper mathematical understanding
- Including practical considerations for real-world applications
- Demonstrating debugging and problem-solving approaches

Students learn not just the concepts, but also how to handle common issues and make robust implementations.
