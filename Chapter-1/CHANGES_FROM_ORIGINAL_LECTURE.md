# Changes Made from Original Lecture Examples

This document summarizes the modifications made to the lecture examples to improve functionality, fix errors, and enhance educational value.

## Examples Modified

### 1. Example 1 - Reading Dataset (`example_1_read_dataset.py`)
**Changes:**
- Removed `load_boston` from imports

**Reasons:**
- `load_boston` was deprecated and removed from scikit-learn 1.2+ due to ethical concerns about racial bias in the dataset
- Function now raises ImportError when called
- Alternative: `fetch_california_housing` is available for housing price prediction tasks

### 2. Example 5 - Gradient Descent (`example_5_gradient_descent.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added overflow protection with try-catch blocks
- Added divergence detection for large values
- Used adaptive learning rates for different starting points (α=0.05 for x=2.0,4.0 and α=0.01 for x=-1.0)
- Fixed matplotlib plotting format strings

**Reasons:**
- Original example crashed with OverflowError when starting from x=-1.0
- Gradient descent can diverge with poor learning rate selection
- Different starting points may require different learning rates for numerical stability
- Demonstrates both successful convergence and problematic divergence scenarios
- Educational value: shows importance of hyperparameter tuning

### 3. Example 6 - Binary Cross-Entropy (`example_6_binary_cross_entropy.py`)
**Changes:**
- Fixed array broadcasting issue in probability distribution visualization
- Enhanced probability generation using proper boolean indexing

**Reasons:**
- Original `np.where` usage caused broadcasting errors with incompatible array shapes
- Fixed by using proper indexing with boolean masks for different classes
- Ensures visualization works correctly for all sample sizes

### 4. Example 7 - Sigmoid Activation (`example_7_sigmoid_activation.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added overflow protection by clipping z values to [-500, 500]
- Enhanced visualizations and mathematical explanations

**Reasons:**
- Original sigmoid function can cause overflow errors for large input values
- `np.clip(-500, 500)` prevents numerical instability while maintaining function behavior
- Enhanced educational content provides deeper understanding

### 5. Example 8 - Tanh Activation (`example_8_tanh_activation.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive comparisons with other activation functions
- Enhanced visualizations showing derivatives and properties

**Reasons:**
- Provides deeper understanding beyond basic definition
- Shows relationships between different activation functions
- Includes practical considerations for choosing activation functions

### 6. Example 9 - Softmax Activation (`example_9_softmax_activation.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added numerical stability by subtracting max value before exponentiation
- Enhanced with temperature scaling and multi-class examples

**Reasons:**
- Original softmax can cause overflow for large input values
- Subtracting `max(z)` prevents numerical overflow while maintaining mathematical correctness
- Shows practical applications and variations

### 7. Example 10 - Regression Metrics (`example_10_regression_metrics.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive metric calculations with manual implementations
- Enhanced visualizations showing residual analysis
- Added practical examples with different error types

**Reasons:**
- Provides complete understanding beyond basic definitions
- Shows how different metrics respond to different error types
- Includes both sklearn and manual implementations for learning
- Helps choose appropriate metrics for different scenarios

### 8. Example 11 - Confusion Matrix (`example_11_confusion_matrix.py`)
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive visualization with 12 different plots
- Added manual metric calculations with step-by-step explanations
- Added multi-class confusion matrix example
- Added threshold analysis and ROC-like curves

**Reasons:**
- Original likely showed basic confusion matrix concepts only
- Enhanced version provides complete understanding of classification metrics
- Includes both binary and multi-class scenarios
- Provides visual and mathematical intuition for all key concepts

## Homework Modified

### Homework 1 - Load Datasets (`homework_1_load_datasets.py`)
**Changes:**
- Removed `load_boston` from imports and dataset list

**Reasons:**
- Same as Example 1 - ethical concerns and ImportError in newer scikit-learn versions

## Common Themes in Changes

1. **Numerical Stability**: Added overflow protection and clipping to prevent crashes
2. **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and graceful degradation
3. **Educational Enhancement**: Added detailed explanations, visualizations, and step-by-step calculations
4. **Practical Considerations**: Included real-world scenarios and best practices
5. **Compatibility**: Fixed deprecated functions and updated for newer library versions

## Impact on Learning

These changes enhance the educational value by:
- Preventing crashes that would interrupt learning
- Showing both successful and problematic scenarios
- Providing deeper mathematical understanding
- Including practical considerations for real-world applications
- Demonstrating debugging and problem-solving approaches

Students learn not just the concepts, but also how to handle common issues and make robust implementations.
