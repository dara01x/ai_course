## File Dependencies

All files are self-contained but require the following libraries:
- `numpy`: Numerical computations
- `matplotlib`: Plotting and visualization
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms and datasets
- `seaborn`: Enhanced visualizations
- `scipy`: Scientific computing (for some advanced examples)

## Learning Objectives

By working through these examples and homework, you will:

1. **Understand ML Fundamentals**: Learn the basic types and workflow of machine learning
2. **Master Data Handling**: Know how to load, split, and prepare datasets
3. **Implement Core Algorithms**: Build gradient descent and understand optimization
4. **Comprehend Loss Functions**: Calculate and interpret different loss functions
5. **Use Activation Functions**: Understand how different activations work
6. **Evaluate Models**: Calculate and interpret evaluation metrics manually
7. **Analyze Performance**: Use confusion matrices and various metrics effectively

Each file is extensively commented and includes both theoretical explanations and practical implementations, making it suitable for both learning and reference.
