# About Chapter Two - Feature Engineering

This directory contains examples from Chapter Two, focusing on Feature Engineering techniques.

**Note: Run any Python file to see educational output with explanations!**

## Key Concepts
- **Feature Imputation**: Handling missing values (mean, median, mode)
- **Feature Encoding**: Converting categorical to numerical data
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalization, Standardization, transformations
- **Feature Selection**: Filter, wrapper, and embedded methods
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA for data compression

## Quick Start
**Prerequisites:** `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`
```bash
python examples/example_1_normalization.py           # Feature scaling
python examples/example_4_correlation_analysis.py   # Feature relationships
python examples/example_9_pca_reduction.py          # Dimensionality reduction
```

## Learning Goals
Master feature engineering techniques to improve ML model performance through data preprocessing, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction.
