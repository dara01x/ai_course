# Changes from Original Lecture

## Key Enhancements

- Added comprehensive documentation and visualizations
- Enhanced performance analysis and best practices
- Improved error handling and code structure
- Added sklearn comparisons and statistical analysis

## Example Modifications

### Example 1-3 (Normalization & Thresholds)
- Added manual implementations with verification
- Enhanced feature ranking and decision guidance

### Example 4-5 (Correlation)
- Split into numpy and pandas-based implementations
- Added visualization and interpretation

### Example 6-8 (Feature Selection)
- Added multiple scoring functions and estimators
- Implemented statistical significance testing

### Example 9 (PCA)
- Added eigenvalue calculations and component interpretation
- Enhanced visualization of explained variance

## New Concepts
- Target encoding for categorical variables
- Robust scaling and KNN imputation
- LDA vs PCA comparison
- Feature importance rankings

## Educational Value
- Interactive, self-contained examples
- Mathematical foundations explained
- Real-world application guidelines
- Manual implementations validated against sklearn

These modifications ensure students learn both implementation techniques and underlying concepts for real-world applications.
