This directory contains examples from Chapter Three, focusing on Supervised Learning Algorithms.

**Note: Run any Python file to see educational output with explanations!**

## Key Concepts
- **Linear Regression**: OLS, Ridge, Lasso regularization techniques
- **Polynomial Regression**: Modeling non-linear relationships
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification using sigmoid activation
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Linear and non-linear classification
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**: Instance-based learning
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-based interpretable models
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning with multiple trees
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search and cross-validation

## Quick Start
**Prerequisites:** `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn`
```bash
python examples/example_1_simple_linear_regression.py    # Linear regression basics
python examples/example_7_svm_classification.py          # Support Vector Machine
python examples/example_12_random_forest.py              # Ensemble learning
```

## Learning Goals
Master supervised learning algorithms for predictive modeling, covering regression and classification techniques with model optimization strategies.
